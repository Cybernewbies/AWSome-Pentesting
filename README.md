# AWSome Pentesting Cheatsheet

* Pull requests are appreciated :)
* This guide was created to help pentesters learning more about AWS misconfigurations and ways to abuse them. 
* It was created with my notes gathered with uncontable hours of study and annotations from various places
* It's assumed that you have the AWS keys (~~This is not difficult to find, just look in developer's github~~)
* Author -> pop3ret
